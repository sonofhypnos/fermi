Use the formula for the volume of a sphere to find the volume of the hollow sphere.\n5. Calculate the radius of the hollow sphere in inches.\n6. Convert the volume to square inches.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to our current problem:\n\n1. An English penny has a diameter of approximately 0.75 inches and a thickness of 0.061 inches. Assuming it is a cylinder, the volume would be approximately 0.026 cubic inches.\n2. An English penny is typically made of copper, which has an atomic radius of about 0.128 nanometers. Assuming the atoms are arranged in a simple cubic lattice, we can estimate the number of atoms in the penny.\n3. The radius of the hollow sphere with a thickness of 1 atom would be the atomic radius plus the thickness of the penny, which is approximately 0.128 + 0.061 = 0.189 nanometers.\n4. Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3, we can calculate the volume of the hollow sphere.\n5.

The volume of an English penny can be estimated by assuming it is a cylinder with a diameter of 20.3 mm and a thickness of 1.52 mm.\n   - Volume of a cylinder = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n   - Assuming the penny is a perfect cylinder, the volume would be approximately 3.06 cm^3.\n\n2. The density of the material in the penny is approximately 7.8 g/cm^3.\n\n3. The mass of the penny can be estimated by multiplying the volume by the density.\n   - Mass = Volume * Density = 3.06 cm^3 * 7.8 g/cm^3 = 23.87 g.\n\n4. The molar mass of the material in the penny (assuming it is pure copper) is approximately 63.55 g/mol.\n\n5. The number of moles of atoms in the penny can be calculated by dividing the mass by the molar mass.\n   - Moles = Mass / Molar mass = 23.87 g / 63.55 g/mol = 0.376 moles.\n\n6. Avogadro's number tells us that there are approximately 6.022 x 10^23 atoms in one mole.\n\n7.

The thickness of the stretched penny is given as 1 atom thick.\n\n2. The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r^3, where r is the radius.\n\n3. The volume of the sphere in this case would be equal to the volume of the penny, as the material is conserved.\n   - 3.06 cm^3 = (4/3)\u03c0r^3.\n\n4. Solving for the radius, we get:\n   - r = (3 * 3.06 / (4 * \u03c0))^(1/3) \u2248 0.88 cm.\n\n5. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4\u03c0r^2.\n   - Surface area of the sphere \u2248 4\u03c0 * (0.88)^2 \u2248 9.74 cm^2.\n\nCalculating the mean of the results from both approaches:\n\nMean result = (3.06 + 9.74) / 2 = 6.4 cm^2.\n\n```result = 6.4\n```"
