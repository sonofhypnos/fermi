Average fuel efficiency of cars after the change: 25 miles per gallon\n\nNow, let's calculate the total gallons of gas saved per year:\n\n- Total gallons of gas consumed before the change = (Total number of cars) * (Average miles driven per car per year) / (Average fuel efficiency before the change)\n- Total gallons of gas consumed after the change = (Total number of cars) * (Average miles driven per car per year) / (Average fuel efficiency after the change)\n- Total gallons of gas saved per year = Total gallons of gas consumed before the change - Total gallons of gas consumed after the change\n\nLet's calculate the final result using the estimates and assumptions provided above:\n\n```python\ntotal_cars = 280e6\navg_miles_driven_per_car_per_year = 12000\navg_fuel_efficiency_before_change = 20\navg_fuel_efficiency_after_change = 25\n\ntotal_gas_consumed_before_change = total_cars * avg_miles_driven_per_car_per_year / avg_fuel_efficiency_before_change\ntotal_gas_consumed_after_change = total_cars * avg_miles_driven_per_car_per_year / avg_fuel_efficiency_after_change\ntotal_gas_saved_per_year = total_gas_consumed_before_change - total_gas_consumed_after_change\n\nresult = total_gas_saved_per_year\n```\n\nThe final result will be the total gallons of gas saved per year in the U.S. if all cars got at least 25 miles per gallon."

The illuminance at a point on a surface decreases with the square of the distance from the light source (Inverse Square Law). Therefore, we can estimate the total luminous flux reaching the walls by considering the lightbulb as a point source.\n\nLet's assume the lightbulb is at the center of a cubic room. The luminous flux reaching each wall will be spread over the entire surface area of the cube. The total area of the walls is 6 times the area of one wall.\n\nThe relationship between luminous flux, illuminance, and distance is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{\\Phi}{4 \\pi d^2} \\]\n\nThe total luminous flux reaching the walls is given by:\n\\[ \\Phi_{\\text{wall}} = E \\times A_{\\text{walls}} \\]\n\nSince we want the illuminance at the walls to be zero, we can set \\( \\Phi_{\\text{wall}} = 0 \\) and solve for the distance \\( d \\) from the lightbulb to the walls.\n\nLet's make some assumptions for our Fermi estimate:\n- The lightbulb is a point source.\n- The room is a perfect cube.\n- The walls are perfectly reflective.\n- The lightbulb emits light uniformly in all directions.\n\nNow, let's calculate the size of the room required for the lightbulb to cast no light on any walls.

If we assume that this trend continues, we can estimate the number of transistors on a chip over time.\n\n3. **Clock Cycles per Instruction (CPI)**: The number of clock cycles required to execute an instruction is an important factor in determining the overall speed of a computer. Let's assume an average CPI of 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Instructions per Cycle (IPC)**: The number of instructions that can be executed per clock cycle also impacts the overall performance. Let's assume an average IPC of 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Number of Cores**: The number of cores in a processor affects the parallel processing capability. Let's assume a typical home computer has 4 cores.\n\nNow, let's calculate the theoretical processing speed of the average home computer by now:\n\n- Assuming Moore's Law has been followed, the number of transistors on a chip would have doubled approximately 11 times since 2000 (2021-2000 = 21 years / 2 years per doubling).\n- This means the number of transistors on a chip would be 2^11 = 2048 times greater than in 2000.\n- Given that the clock speed is 3 GHz, and assuming CPI = 1 and IPC = 1, the theoretical processing speed would be:\n  \n  3 GHz * 2048 (transistor increase) * 4 (number of cores) = 24,576 GHz\n\nTherefore, the estimated processing speed of the average home computer by now would be 24,576 GHz.\n\n```python\nresult = 3 * 2**11 * 4\n```"

Total value of everything Bill Gates owned in 2009: This is a challenging variable to estimate accurately, but we can make a rough guess based on his net worth at that time.\n\nLet's make some assumptions and calculations:\n\n- Bill Gates' net worth in 2009 was around $50 billion.\n- Let's assume he could have acquired all the Bitcoins available in 2009, which was around 1.5 million Bitcoins.\n- The price of Bitcoin in December 2017 reached around $20,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of his Bitcoin holdings in December 2017:\n\nTotal Bitcoins acquired = Total value of everything Bill Gates owned in 2009 / Starting price of Bitcoin\nTotal value in 2017 = Total Bitcoins acquired * Price of Bitcoin in 2017\n\nLet's calculate the final result in dollars:\n\n```python\nstarting_price_bitcoin = 0.001\nprice_bitcoin_2017 = 20000\nbill_gates_net_worth_2009 = 50000000000\ntotal_bitcoins_acquired = bill_gates_net_worth_2009 / starting_price_bitcoin\ntotal_value_2017 = total_bitcoins_acquired * price_bitcoin_2017\n\nresult = total_value_2017\n``` \n\nTherefore, Bill Gates would have made approximately $1 trillion if he traded everything he owned for Bitcoin in 2009 and sold in December 2017."

Number of movies and TV shows produced annually:\n   - North America and Europe are major players in the global entertainment industry, producing a significant portion of movies and TV shows.\n   - Let's estimate that North America produces around 600 movies and 400 TV shows annually, while Europe produces around 400 movies and 300 TV shows annually.\n\n2. Average production budget per movie and TV show:\n   - The production budget varies widely depending on the scale and type of production. Blockbuster movies and high-quality TV shows tend to have larger budgets.\n   - Let's estimate the average production budget per movie to be $50 million and per TV show to be $5 million.\n\n3. Marketing and distribution costs:\n   - Marketing and distribution costs are a significant part of the total budget for movies and TV shows.\n   - Let's estimate that marketing and distribution costs are on average 50% of the production budget for both movies and TV shows.\n\n4. Other costs:\n   - There are other costs involved in the production of movies and TV shows, such as salaries, equipment, location costs, etc.\n   - Let's estimate that these other costs amount to 25% of the total budget for both movies and TV shows.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total yearly budget for the North American and European movie and television industries combined:\n\nFor North America:\nTotal budget for movies = (600 * $50 million * 1.5) + (400 * $5 million * 1.5) = $45 billion\nTotal budget for TV shows = (400 * $50 million * 1.5) + (300 * $5 million * 1.5) = $30 billion\n\nFor Europe:\nTotal budget for movies = (400 * $50 million * 1.5) + (300 * $5 million * 1.5) = $30 billion\nTotal budget for TV shows = (300 * $50 million * 1.5) + (200 * $5 million * 1.5) = $22.5 billion\n\nCombining North America and Europe:\nTotal yearly budget = $45 billion + $30 billion + $30 billion + $22.5 billion = $127.5 billion\n\nTherefore, the estimated yearly budget of the North American and European movie and television industries combined is $127.5 billion.\n\n```python\nresult = 127500000000\n```"

Volume of a golf ball:\n   - A standard golf ball has a diameter of about 1.68 inches.\n   - Assuming a golf ball is roughly a sphere, we can calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3, where r is the radius of the golf ball (half of the diameter).\n\n2. Volume of the 5-gallon water cooler jug:\n   - 1 US gallon is approximately 231 cubic inches.\n   - Therefore, a 5-gallon water cooler jug would have a volume of 5 * 231 cubic inches.\n\n3. Estimation:\n   - Let's assume that the golf balls can be tightly packed without any gaps between them.\n   - We can estimate the number of golf balls that could fit in the water cooler jug by dividing the volume of the jug by the volume of a single golf ball.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final estimate:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\ngolf_ball_diameter = 1.68  # inches\ngolf_ball_radius = golf_ball_diameter / 2\nwater_jug_volume = 5 * 231  # cubic inches\n\n# Calculate the volume of a golf ball\ngolf_ball_volume = (4/3) * math.pi * golf_ball_radius**3\n\n# Estimate the number of golf balls that could fit in the water cooler jug\nnum_golf_balls = water_jug_volume // golf_ball_volume\n\nresult = int(num_golf_balls)\n```\n\nThe final estimate for the number of golf balls that could fit in a 5-gallon water cooler jug is calculated to be stored in the `result` variable."

Let's assume 5.25 million cells per microliter for both males and females.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of RBCs for both an adult male and an adult female:\n\nFor an adult male:\nTotal Blood Volume = 5.5 liters = 5500 ml\nRBC count = 5.25 million cells/\u03bcL\n\nTotal RBCs in an adult male = Total Blood Volume * RBC count\nTotal RBCs in an adult male = 5500 ml * 5.25 million cells/\u03bcL\n\nFor an adult female:\nTotal Blood Volume = 4.5 liters = 4500 ml\nRBC count = 5.25 million cells/\u03bcL\n\nTotal RBCs in an adult female = Total Blood Volume * RBC count\nTotal RBCs in an adult female = 4500 ml * 5.25 million cells/\u03bcL\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in the number of RBCs between an adult male and an adult female:\n\nDifference in RBCs = Total RBCs in an adult male - Total RBCs in an adult female\n\nFinally, we convert the difference in RBCs to liters:\n\n1 liter = 10^6 \u03bcL\n\nTherefore, the final calculation is:\n\n```python\nresult = (5500 * 5.25 - 4500 * 5.25) / 10**6\n``` \n\nThis will give us the difference in the number of RBCs between an adult male and an adult female in liters."

Number of unique checkouts:\n   Assuming that each checkout is unique (i.e., each time a book is checked out, it counts as a separate checkout), this would be the same as the total number of checkouts.\n\n5. Percentage of library books checked out at least once:\n   This can be calculated by dividing the number of unique checkouts by the total number of library books, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nLet's calculate the final estimate based on the assumptions above: \n\n```python\ntotal_books = 1e6\navg_checkouts_per_book = 5\n\ntotal_checkouts = total_books * avg_checkouts_per_book\nunique_checkouts = total_checkouts\npercentage_checked_out = (unique_checkouts / total_books) * 100\n\nresult = percentage_checked_out\n```"

Since gold has an atomic number of 79, we can estimate the number of protons as 79. The number of neutrons can be approximated as the atomic mass minus the atomic number, so N = 197 - 79 = 118.\n\n2. **Radius of the Nucleus (r)**: The radius of the nucleus can be estimated using the empirical formula for the nuclear radius, which is approximately given by \\( r = r_0 \\times A^{1/3} \\), where \\( r_0 \\) is a constant. For gold, we can estimate \\( r_0 \\) to be around 1.2 femtometers (1.2 x 10^-15 meters). Substituting A = 197 into the formula, we get \\( r \\approx 1.2 \\times 197^{1/3} \\) femtometers.\n\n3. **Volume of the Nucleus**: The volume of a sphere is given by \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\pi \\times r^3 \\). Substituting the estimated radius into this formula will give us the volume of the gold nucleus.\n\n4. **Mass of the Nucleus**: The mass of the nucleus can be estimated as the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons. The mass of a proton and neutron is approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu) each. Therefore, the mass of the nucleus is approximately \\( N \\times 1 \\) amu.\n\n5. **Density Calculation**: Finally, we can calculate the density of the gold nucleus by dividing the estimated mass by the volume we calculated earlier.\n\nLet's put all these steps together in a Python executable expression:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\natomic_number = 79\natomic_mass = 197  # in g/mol\nr0 = 1.2e-15  # in meters\n\n# Number of nucleons\nN = atomic_mass - atomic_number\n\n# Radius of the nucleus\nr = r0 * atomic_mass**(1/3)\n\n# Volume of the nucleus\nV = (4/3) * math.pi * r**3\n\n# Mass of the nucleus\nmass = N * 1  # assuming mass of nucleon is 1 amu\n\n# Density calculation\ndensity = mass / V * 1e-6  # converting to g/cm^3\n\nresult = density\n```\n\nBy running this Python code, we can estimate the density of the gold atom nucleus."

Calculate the decrease in luminosity per second:\n   Decrease in luminosity per second = Total energy released per second / Age of the sun in seconds\n   Decrease in luminosity per second = (4.2 x 10^9 kg/s * 6.3 x 10^14 J/kg) / (4.5 x 10^9 years * 365 days/year * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour)\n\nNow, we can calculate the decrease in luminosity per second in Watts:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nmass_loss_rate = 4.2e9  # kg/s\nenergy_per_unit_mass = 6.3e14  # J/kg\nage_of_sun_seconds = 4.5e9 * 365 * 24 * 3600  # years to seconds\n\ntotal_energy_per_second = mass_loss_rate * energy_per_unit_mass\ndecrease_in_luminosity_per_second = total_energy_per_second / age_of_sun_seconds\n\nresult = decrease_in_luminosity_per_second\n```"

Impact force required to knock down/faint a person: This force needs to overcome the person's stability and potentially cause injury.\n\nTo estimate the force required, we can use the formula for force:\n\n\\[ F = m \\cdot a \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the force required to knock down/faint a person,\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the snowball,\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration experienced by the person upon impact.\n\nThe acceleration can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{v^2}{2d} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of the snowball,\n- \\( d \\) is the distance over which the person is brought to a stop (assumed to be the thickness of the person).\n\nAssuming the snowball comes to a stop upon impact, the distance \\( d \\) can be approximated as the thickness of a person, which we can estimate as 0.3 meters.\n\nGiven that the snowball is brought to a stop upon impact, the force required to knock down/faint a person can be estimated as:\n\n\\[ F = m_{snowball} \\cdot \\frac{v_{snowball}^2}{2 \\cdot 0.3} \\]\n\nNow, let's plug in the estimated values and calculate the force in Newtons:\n\n- \\( m_{snowball} = 0.1 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- \\( v_{snowball} \\) is the variable we need to estimate. Let's assume a typical throwing speed for a snowball is around 10 m/s.\n\nNow, we can calculate the force required:\n\n\\[ F = 0.1 \\times \\frac{10^2}{2 \\times 0.3} \\]\n\n\\[ F = 16.67 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated force required to knock down/faint a person with a snowball thrown at 10 m/s is approximately 16.67 N.\n\n```python\nm_snowball = 0.1  # kg\nv_snowball = 10  # m/s\nd = 0.3  # m\n\nF = m_snowball * (v_snowball**2) / (2 * d)\nresult = F\n```"

The MVP is the smallest population size that can ensure a high probability of survival and reproduction over a specified time frame.\n\nKey variables to consider:\n1. Effective population size (Ne): This is the number of individuals in a population who contribute offspring to the next generation. It is usually smaller than the total population size due to factors like unequal reproductive success.\n2. Inbreeding coefficient (F): This measures the probability that two alleles at a given locus are identical by descent, which can lead to genetic disorders due to increased homozygosity.\n3. Mutation rate: The rate at which new genetic variations arise in a population.\n4. Generation time: The average time between the birth of an individual and the birth of its offspring.\n\nThe formula to estimate the MVP size is:\nMVP = 4 * Ne * (1 + F) / (1 - F)\n\nTo avoid worrying about incest in future generations, we aim to keep the inbreeding coefficient (F) low. Let's assume a conservative value for F, such as 0.01, to minimize the risk of genetic disorders due to inbreeding.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Ne is typically estimated to be around 500 to 1,000 for long-term genetic viability.\n- Mutation rate is relatively low compared to Ne and can be ignored for this estimation.\n- Generation time is around 25 years.\n\nNow, we can calculate the MVP using the formula mentioned above:\n\nNe = 750 (average of 500 and 1000)\nF = 0.01\nMVP = 4 * 750 * (1 + 0.01) / (1 - 0.01)\n\n```{python}\nimport math\n\nNe = 750\nF = 0.01\nresult = 4 * Ne * (1 + F) / (1 - F)\n```"

Average weight of roads and pavements: Let's estimate the weight of roads and pavements per person to be 100 kg.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total weight of the city by summing up the weights of all these components:\n\nTotal weight = (Population * (Weight per person + Weight of buildings and infrastructure + Weight of vehicles + Weight of green spaces + Weight of water bodies + Weight of roads and pavements))\n\nSubstitute the estimated values into the formula:\n\nTotal weight = (1,000,000 * (70 + 700 + 500 + 50 + 20 + 100))\n\nCalculating the total weight:\n\nTotal weight = 1,000,000 * (70 + 700 + 500 + 50 + 20 + 100) = 1,000,000 * 1440 = 1,440,000,000 kg\n\nTherefore, the estimated weight of a mid-sized city with 1 million people is 1,440,000,000 kg.\n\n```python\nresult = 1000000 * (70 + 700 + 500 + 50 + 20 + 100)\n```"
